If Im on a random branch, and I want to switch to main branch

1. git checkout main (like cd in linux) (Used to move between branches that already exist)
   # ACTION: Switches your local workspace to the 'main' branch.
   # WHAT IS 'LOCAL WORKSPACE'? The actual folder on your laptop where you are writing code.
   # WHY: You must be ON the branch you want to update.
   # NOTE: If you have unsaved changes, Git might stop you. Commit or stash them first.

2. git checkout -b new-branch-name (Used to create a new branch)
   # ACTION: Creates a new branch named 'new-branch-name' and switches to it.
   # WHY: You want to work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the 'main' branch.
   # NOTE: If you already have a branch named 'new-branch-name', Git will stop you.

3. git pull origin main (like cat main.txt in linux)
   # ACTION: Downloads the latest code from GitHub (origin) and merges it into your local 'main'.
   # WHY: Your teammate might have pushed new code. You need to sync up before you start working.
   # BREAKDOWN: 'pull' = 'fetch' (download) + 'merge' (combine). 

4. Q: Can't I just run `git pull origin main` directly?
   # A: YES, but be careful.
   # IF you are on 'feature-branch' and run `git pull origin main`, 
   # it will merge 'main' INTO 'feature-branch'.
   # IF you wanted to update your local 'main', you MUST checkout 'main' first. 

4. Q: What is 'origin'?
   # A: It is a NICKNAME for your GitHub URL.
   # Instead of typing: git push https://github.com/43vignesh34/AssessmentApplication.git main
   # You type: git push origin main
   # 'origin' = 'https://github.com/43vignesh34/AssessmentApplication.git'
