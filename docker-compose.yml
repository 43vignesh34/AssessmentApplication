    #Name we are giving to SpringBoot service. We can name it anything.
    #But it is good practice to name it something meaningful.

    #Don't go to the internet to download an image for this service. Instead, look in this exact folder (.) for a 
    #Dockerfile, read the instructions in it, and build a brand-new custom image out of my source code right now."

      #We are mapping the host port 8080 to the container port 8080.
      #By default, Docker containers run in total isolation. Even though your Spring Boot
      # app is running on port 8080 inside the container, your Mac cannot reach it unless 
      #we explicitly poke a hole for it
